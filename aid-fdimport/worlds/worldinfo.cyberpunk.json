He was challenged for allowing the children of statics join the Jode schools, for hiring gangs to keep them from vandalizing nomad projects, for accepting refugees from the Long Walk. yet in every incident, time has vindicated his decisions, which in turn caused many of his personal beliefs to be embraced by the Jodes as a whole. Nevertheless, Malachi has not rested on his laurels, and like Juan Aldecaldo, he would prefer to spare his nation the politicization of their future. But he realizes that he is getting older, and unless he finds a successor soon, there will be no choice.\n\nMalachi Jode is a tall, gaunt man with hair the color of ash and sand. His skin has been darkened by the sun and his features are neutral enough that his ethnicity is a subject of quiet debate. He speaks in a quiet, even, and powerful voice; the voice of authority. Malachi dresses, as do the other members of the Jodes, in denims and loose handmade shirts. His clothing is adorned with patterns reminiscent of Navajo designs. Malachi also usually wears an army surplus load-bearing vest which is reinforced and armored, with numerous pockets carrying small equipment. Malachi usually travels with fewer people in his entourage than the other nomad leaders, and he eschews air travel for all but the most important occasions.WINN, R. Neo Tribes. 1st ed.

After the Nuke Incident and the destruction of the Arasaka Twin Towers complex it became the site of temporary refugee camps and favelas for the next 25 years.\n\nThis situation persisted until the early 2050s, when the NC government, backed by the megacorporations, decided to clear the area by force. Proclaimed as a \"war against crime\" by the corporate-owned media, this action became a synonym of corporate brutality and prejudice. The North Oak favelas were pacified and razed by corporate developers, and in a few years the area became the most prized part of Night City. Years of the ongoing corporate-media campaign eventually watered down and finally hushed the whole incident, not only to avoid negative PR, but to raise land value. Many rich people were initially reluctant to buy land where some dirty homeless folk had once lived.\n\nThese days that history is all but forgotten, and North Oak is home to the untouchable elite: corporate CEOs, hedge fund managers, and investment bankers, but also to the various showbiz figures: BD producers and stars, media personalities and musicians.\n\nMost people are not welcomed here, and private security is tight. I had to rent an aerial vehicle just to catch a glimpse of the famous district. The area consists of vast estates, some of them with their own micro-biome and artificially created landscape. Both the Arasaka Estate and Kerry Eurodyne's villa are within North Oak, because here it doesn't matter whether you're a corporate owner or a renegade rockerboy, the only thing that matters is how wealthy you are.

Proclaimed as a \"war against crime\" by the corporate-owned media, this action became a synonym of corporate brutality and prejudice. The North Oak favelas were pacified and razed by corporate developers, and in a few years the area became the most prized part of Night City. Years of the ongoing corporate-media campaign eventually watered down and finally hushed the whole incident, not only to avoid negative PR, but to raise land value. Many rich people were initially reluctant to buy land where some dirty homeless folk had once lived.\n\nThese days that history is all but forgotten, and North Oak is home to the untouchable elite: corporate CEOs, hedge fund managers, and investment bankers, but also to the various showbiz figures: BD producers and stars, media personalities and musicians.\n\nMost people are not welcomed here, and private security is tight. I had to rent an aerial vehicle just to catch a glimpse of the famous district. The area consists of vast estates, some of them with their own micro-biome and artificially created landscape. Both the Arasaka Estate and Kerry Eurodyne's villa are within North Oak, because here it doesn't matter whether you're a corporate owner or a renegade rockerboy, the only thing that matters is how wealthy you are. Every Night City citizen dreams of living here.",

Recently, they have been forced to move into extortion and smuggling in efforts to pay their bills. While they operate all throughout the city, the 6th Street all are welcome protectors of the Holy Angels Church in Little Europe. (pg.308) 6th Street was meant to serve and protect the community of Vista del Rey. Today their interpretation of the law and \"bringing justice to the city\" is questionable and self-serving.Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter\n\nThe 6th Street gang was founded by old-fashioned American patriots who came together to act as an ad hoc police force. They have since forgone their original goal of serving public trust and are no different than any other gang who abuse their power and position in local communities. They regularly force smaller neighborhood businesses to pay tribute and \"protection money,\" and are known to engage in various and outright criminal activities.\n\nThe uniforms of 6th Street gangers are heavily influenced by military and patriotic accents: military boots, tactical vests and knee pads, cargo pants, baseball caps with old USA flags, stars, stripes, and eagles. Cyberware used by the gang include cyberoptics, pain editors, and health monitors. (pg. 166)\n\nBy 2077, 6th Street was supplied by Militech and Kendachi.\n\n\n\nThe gang consists of about 2,300 members. 6th Street was formed about fifty years ago by veterans of the Fourth Corporate War who were tired of the local gangs and the helplessness of the NCPD and decided to take matters into their own hands. They gathered some equipment, refreshed themselves on their training, and then took to the streets.\n\nThe gang was created to keep thugs and hoodlums at bay, and the charismatic leaders gave people a way protect themselves and seek retribution for the damage caused by other gangs. 6th Street gangers today are veterans of more recent conflicts, retired military and discharged corporate security officers who were unable to find other employment.

    "entry": "\nFounded by veterans of the fourth Corporate War tired of the helplessness of the NCPD, members of 6th Street in 2045 are generally well-armed and heavily cybered-up with armament from their days in the field. Recently, they have been forced to move into extortion and smuggling in efforts to pay their bills. While they operate all throughout the city, the 6th Street all are welcome protectors of the Holy Angels Church in Little Europe. (pg.308) 6th Street was meant to serve and protect the community of Vista del Rey. Today their interpretation of the law and \"bringing justice to the city\" is questionable and self-serving.Cyberpunk 2077 Twitter\n\nThe 6th Street gang was founded by old-fashioned American patriots who came together to act as an ad hoc police force. They have since forgone their original goal of serving public trust and are no different than any other gang who abuse their power and position in local communities. They regularly force smaller neighborhood businesses to pay tribute and \"protection money,\" and are known to engage in various and outright criminal activities.\n\nThe uniforms of 6th Street gangers are heavily influenced by military and patriotic accents: military boots, tactical vests and knee pads, cargo pants, baseball caps with old USA flags, stars, stripes, and eagles. Cyberware used by the gang include cyberoptics, pain editors, and health monitors. (pg. 166)\n\nBy 2077, 6th Street was supplied by Militech and Kendachi.\n\n\n\nThe gang consists of about 2,300 members. 6th Street was formed about fifty years ago by veterans of the Fourth Corporate War who were tired of the local gangs and the helplessness of the NCPD and decided to take matters into their own hands. They gathered some equipment, refreshed themselves on their training, and then took to the streets.\n\nThe gang was created to keep thugs and hoodlums at bay, and the charismatic leaders gave people a way protect themselves and seek retribution for the damage caused by other gangs. 6th Street gangers today are veterans of more recent conflicts, retired military and discharged corporate security officers who were unable to find other employment. The rest of the gang consists of civilians who received military training after joining.\n\nTheir main headquarters of the gang is in Arroyo but the other districts under their control have their own local HQs that are responsible for patrolling the neighborhood and monitoring the gang's facilities.\n\n\n6th Street's operations include robbery, extortion, and gun smuggling.

She would be quite happy to see Trent Parker pushed out of the company completely, and she is working toward this goal.\n\nEllen was born in France in 1945, the daughter of a former resistance soldier and an American nurse. She dreamed of being an actress, and had a moderately successful film career as a sex diva in the mid and late 1960s. She never made it big in America, however, and she retired from acting in the mid 1970s. She had made a fair amount of money before the cameras, and decided to invest it. Her skills in money management far exceeded her skills as an actress, and within a few years she was sitting on top of a considerable fortune.

Its colonial core centers on the Padang, a cricket field since the 1830s and now flanked by grand buildings such as City Hall, with its 18 Corinthian columns. In Singapore's circa-1820 Chinatown stands the red-and-gold Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, said to house one of Buddha's teeth.",
