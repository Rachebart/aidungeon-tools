In 2020, the US had one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, with 90% of the wealth controlled by 10% of the population. Over 65% of the population lived in squalid misery, and another 25-50,000,000 were disenfranchised, homeless \"nomads\" or boosters wandering the ghost towns of central US.\n\nTotal economic, social, and political breakdown began with the Crash of '94 and resulted in the disintegration of American society and its standing as a world superpower. The subsequent years would come to be known as the Collapse, and would see the deaths of roughly 100,000,000 people as a result of plagues, mutated viruses, terrorist nuclear attacks and complete ecological collapse. The disintegration of NATO and the hardline foreign policy pursued by the \"Gang of Four\" isolated the United States politically and economically; with trade wars increasing the suffering of the American people. The complete destruction of the American economic, political, and social fabric was irreversible. Overburdened by debt, homelessness, and corruption, many bankrupted city governments turned to corporations to take control of governmental functions and public services.\n\nMilitech, one of the worlds largest megacorporations, is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. The megacorp dominates much of the country's politics, with the last few US Presidents being ex-Militech executives. The country focuses much of its budget into Militech, a decision not kept secret from the population. However a power struggle has been present for decades with the Arasaka Corporation controlling much of the economy and protection of the Free States.\n\nThe rebranding of the country as the New United States of America was completed sometime between the end of the Fourth Corporate War and 2040, when president Elizabeth Kress restructured the NUSA. In 2069, Kress' successor, Rosalind Myers, instigated the Unification War to reclaim the Free States. By 2077, the NUSA was the 24th largest economy in the world, and hold only a sliver of its former influence in international affairs.",

In 2020, the US had one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world, with 90% of the wealth controlled by 10% of the population. Over 65% of the population lived in squalid misery, and another 25-50,000,000 were disenfranchised, homeless \"nomads\" or boosters wandering the ghost towns of central US.\n\nTotal economic, social, and political breakdown began with the Crash of '94 and resulted in the disintegration of American society and its standing as a world superpower. The subsequent years would come to be known as the Collapse, and would see the deaths of roughly 100,000,000 people as a result of plagues, mutated viruses, terrorist nuclear attacks and complete ecological collapse. The disintegration of NATO and the hardline foreign policy pursued by the \"Gang of Four\" isolated the United States politically and economically; with trade wars increasing the suffering of the American people. The complete destruction of the American economic, political, and social fabric was irreversible. Overburdened by debt, homelessness, and corruption, many bankrupted city governments turned to corporations to take control of governmental functions and public services.\n\nMilitech, one of the worlds largest megacorporations, is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. The megacorp dominates much of the country's politics, with the last few US Presidents being ex-Militech executives. The country focuses much of its budget into Militech, a decision not kept secret from the population. However a power struggle has been present for decades with the Arasaka Corporation controlling much of the economy and protection of the Free States.\n\nThe rebranding of the country as the New United States of America was completed sometime between the end of the Fourth Corporate War and 2040, when president Elizabeth Kress restructured the NUSA. In 2069, Kress' successor, Rosalind Myers, instigated the Unification War to reclaim the Free States. By 2077, the NUSA was the 24th largest economy in the world, and hold only a sliver of its former influence in international affairs.",

    "description": "Arkady Cherminino is the current Chairman of SovOil's Board of Directors. At SovOil, the Chairmanship is an elected position with a five year term. Central Board members vote among themselves, usually for one of three or four nominees. The Chairman is the nominal head of the corporation, but he has no authority over the Board, except to marshal votes and preside over meetings. He does, however, act as spokesman for the company, and he can cast crucial tie-breaking votes. The Chairman is also the head of the Emergency Committee, when it is invoked.\n\nCherminino is in his second term as Chairman of the Board, serving his eighth year as leader of the corporation. He was voted into the chairmanship after a weary and aging Yarno Kurgasyn retired to an estate in the Crimea. Cherminino has been a model leader for the corporation, winning friends in the Board and in the executive, and helping to keep the sometimes fractious Inner Board unified through a crucial period of SovOil's history. Most analysts predict that he will be elected to a third term in 2021, unless some crisis undermines the Board's confidence in him. SovOil has gone into emergency session only twice in Cherminino's tenure: once when two republics were on the verge of civil war, and once when a wave of terrorist activity in the Philippines and Malaysia threatened the corporation's South China Sea operation. Cherminino acquitted himself well each time, and few people doubt his abilities. He is an especially adept diplomat, and he has been instrumental in settling differences between several of the Soviet republics when the Central Committee has failed. He often acts as a consultant for the Central Committee, a position which gives him a unique opportunity to implement SovOil's hidden agenda.\n\nCherminino is a dynamic, affable man in his mid-fifties. He was a junior member of the SGKP Subcommittee before SovOil privatized; a New Reformist from White Russia. He has ascended to his high position with a quick mind, winning personality, cosmopolitan attitude, and strong entrepreneurial and diplomatic instincts. Despite his friendly demeanor, he is shrewd enough to recognize a power play when he sees one, and he deals with enemies quickly and finally. He is devoted to the Corporation, and dedicated to preserving the legacy of Anatoly Novikovo.MOSS, W. Corporation Report 2020 Volume 3. 1st ed. Berkeley CA: R.Talsorian Games, 1992 (pg.60, 61)",
